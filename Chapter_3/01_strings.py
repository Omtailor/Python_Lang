# Indexing of string starts from zero.
name = 'Tailor' # Single Quoted
# name = "Tailor" # Double Quoted
# name = '''Tailor''' # Triple quoted

# Gives length of string
p = len(name) 
print (p)

# String Slicing- Printing only parts of string.
nameshort = name[0:4] # Prints from 0 to 3 that is Tail
print(nameshort)

# In order to print particular character then
character = name[2] # Prints 'i' here
print (character)

name1 = "Thakur"
print(name[-4:-2]) # it is same as name[2:4]. Both returns 'ak'.
