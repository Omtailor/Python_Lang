# Since Programmer inherits Employee, you should still call the parent constructor to set name and salary. Otherwise, self.name and self.salary donâ€™t exist inside Programmer.

# Super keyword allows you to call methods (like __init__, or any other method) from a parent class (superclass) inside a child class (subclass), without explicitly naming the parent class.
